Persistence is gained when creating an exe using pyinstaller like 
```
pyinstaller -w --onefile revShell_server.py
```
It will add the exe to the registry and will start up on machine startup and user login.

This is part 1 atm and I will build on it more in the future and create a tutorial to go with it for anyone that is interested.
